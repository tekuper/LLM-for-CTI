This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.  Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all resources have been acquired which means that it can also be deregistered on probe deferrals.  In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver (or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to be deallocated.  When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a use-after-free when attaching the bridges:   dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)  which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:   [drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16  or a NULL-pointer dereference:   Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000  ...

In this case, the fix is to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to after all resources have been looked up.  Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see commit fbc35b45f9f6 (""Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER"")).

In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver (or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to be deallocated.  When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a use-after-free when attaching the bridges:   dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)  which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:   [drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16  or a NULL-pointer dereference:   Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000  ...  Call trace:    drm_bridge_attach+0x70/0x1a8 [drm]    drm_aux_bridge_attach+0x24/0x38 [aux_bridge]    drm_bridge_attach+0x80/0x1a8 [drm]    dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]    msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]  The DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on the assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to after all resources have been looked up.  Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see commit fbc35b45f9f6 (""Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER"")).  [DB: slightly fixed commit message by adding the word 'commit'] ",CWE-416,"**Root Cause:** The use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's DRM bridge implementation is caused by the registration of bridges before all resources have been acquired, leading to a race condition where another driver may have looked up and stored a pointer to the bridge before it is deallocated.

**Mitigation Strategy:** To mitigate this vulnerability, the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver should be moved to after all resources have been looked up. This ensures that the bridge will not be deregistered before another driver has had a chance to acquire a reference to it.

",CWE-787,"**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this issue is an incorrect casting of the void * argument to the mlx5e_tx_reporter_dump_sq() function. In the TX-timeout-recovery flow, the argument is of type struct mlx5e_tx_timeout_ctx *, but the function casts it to struct mlx5e_txqsq *. This incorrect casting leads to a kernel stack overflow and a system crash.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
To mitigate this issue, a wrapper function should be added for mlx5e_tx_reporter_dump_sq() that extracts the sq from struct mlx5e_tx_timeout_ctx and sets it as the TX-timeout-recovery flow dump callback. This will ensure that the correct type is passed to the mlx5e_tx_reporter_dump_sq() function and prevent the kernel stack overflow.

Deny the whole profile set replacement in such case and inform user with EPROTO and an explaining message.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org). ",CWE-476,"**Root Cause:**
The root cause of this issue is that the Linux kernel's AppArmor module does not handle the case when the profile name is empty. This can occur when a packed profile is being unpacked and a string like "":samba-dcerpcd"" is passed to the aa_splitn_fqname() function. This function treats "":samba-dcerpcd"" as only containing a namespace, which results in a NULL value being returned for the profile name. This causes the aa_alloc_profile() function to crash due to the NULL profile name.

**Proposed Mitigation Strategy:**
To mitigate this issue, the AppArmor module should be modified to deny the entire profile set replacement in the case when the profile name is empty. The user should also be informed with an EPROTO error message and an explanatory message. This will prevent the crash from occurring and will allow the user to take corrective action.

Insertion into Trusted Root Certification Authorities was the originally intended behavior, and the UI ensured that the certificate installation step (checked by default) was visible to the user before proceeding with the product installation.

This certificate is used for code signing, which allows arbitrary software to be signed and potentially bypass security measures.

**Mitigation Strategy:** To mitigate this issue, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Remove the WDKTestCert certificate from the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store.** This can be done through the Windows Certificate Manager or through a command-line tool such as certutil.
2. **Disable the installation of the certificate during the RustDesk installation process.** This can be done by unchecking the ""Install Certificate"" option during the installation wizard.

In particular, accesses were permitted above state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the stack was already ""large enough"", the access was permitted, but otherwise the access was rejected instead of being allowed to ""grow the stack"". This undesired rejection was happening in two places: - in check_stack_slot_within_bounds() - in check_stack_range_initialized() This patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of tests that were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of them were changed to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old behavior persists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 - because it can't run unprivileged for other reasons.  This patch also fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset reads. This second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one because they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack using registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers with fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the function's needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program to verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime because a too small stack had been allocated for it.  Each function tracks the size of the stack it needs in bpf_subprog_info.stack_depth, which is maintained by update_stack_depth(). For regular memory accesses, check_mem_access() was calling update_state_depth() but it was passing in only the fixed part of the offset register, ignoring the variable offset. This was incorrect; the minimum possible value of that register should be used instead.  This tracking is now fixed by centralizing the tracking of stack size in grow_stack_state(), and by lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to check_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is now simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack size. check_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack having been allocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the first issue.

A critical vulnerability has been identified in the ""/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}"" endpoint. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user within an organization to remove any other user from that same organization, irrespective of their respective roles. This includes the ability to remove users with ""Admin"" and ""Root"" roles. By enabling any organizational member to unilaterally alter the user base, it opens the door to unauthorized access and can cause considerable disruptions in operations. The core of the vulnerability lies in the `remove_user_from_org` function in the user management system. This function is designed to allow organizational users to remove members from their organization. The function does not check if the user initiating the request has the appropriate administrative privileges to remove a user. Any user who is part of the organization, irrespective of their role, can remove any other user, including those with higher privileges. This vulnerability is categorized as an Authorization issue leading to Unauthorized User Removal. The impact is severe, as it compromises the integrity of user management within organizations. By exploiting this vulnerability, any user within an organization, without the need for administrative privileges, can remove critical users, including ""Admins"" and ""Root"" users. This could result in unauthorized system access, administrative lockout, or operational disruptions. Given that user accounts are typically created by ""Admins"" or ""Root"" users, this vulnerability can be exploited by any user who has been granted access to an organization, thereby posing a critical risk to the security and operational stability of the application.

CSRF attacks can be used to perform a variety of actions, such as changing the user's account settings, posting messages, or even making purchases.

**Proposed Mitigation Strategy:** There are a number of ways to mitigate CSRF attacks. One common method is to use a CSRF token. A CSRF token is a unique value that is generated by the server and included in all requests. When a user submits a request, the server checks the CSRF token to make sure that it matches the value that was generated for that user. If the tokens do not match, the request is rejected.

To prevent the sk free, as a holder of the sk, ep should be alive when calling lock_sock(). This patch uses call_rcu() and moves sock_put and ep free into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), so that it's safe to try to hold the ep under rcu_read_lock in sctp_transport_traverse_process().  If sctp_endpoint_hold() returns true, it means this ep is still alive and we have held it and can continue to dump it; If it returns false, it means this ep is dead and can be freed after rcu_read_unlock, and we should skip it.  In sctp_sock_dump(), after locking the sk, if this ep is different from tsp->asoc->ep, it means during this dumping, this asoc was peeled off before calling lock_sock(), and the sk should be skipped; If this ep is the same with tsp->asoc->ep, it means no peeloff happens on this asoc, and due to lock_sock, no peeloff will happen either until release_sock.  Note that delaying endpoint free won't delay the port release, as the port release happens in sctp_endpoint_destroy() before calling call_rcu(). Also, freeing endpoint by call_rcu() makes it safe to access the sk by asoc->base.sk in sctp_assocs_seq_show() and sctp_rcv().

To prevent the sk free, as a holder of the sk, ep should be alive when calling lock_sock(). This patch uses call_rcu() and moves sock_put and ep free into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), so that it's safe to try to hold the ep under rcu_read_lock in sctp_transport_traverse_process().  If sctp_endpoint_hold() returns true, it means this ep is still alive and we have held it and can continue to dump it; If it returns false, it means this ep is dead and can be freed after rcu_read_unlock, and we should skip it.  In sctp_sock_dump(), after locking the sk, if this ep is different from tsp->asoc->ep, it means during this dumping, this asoc was peeled off before calling lock_sock(), and the sk should be skipped; If this ep is the same with tsp->asoc->ep, it means no peeloff happens on this asoc, and due to lock_sock, no peeloff will happen either until release_sock.  Note that delaying endpoint free won't delay the port release, as the port release happens in sctp_endpoint_destroy() before calling call_rcu(). Also, freeing endpoint by call_rcu() makes it safe to access the sk by asoc->base.sk in sctp_assocs_seq_show() and sctp_rcv().  Thanks Jones to bring this issue up.  v1->v2:   - improve the changelog.   - add kfree(ep) into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), as Jakub noticed. ",CWE-416,"**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the issue is a race condition between the freeing of an endpoint (ep) and the subsequent call to lock_sock(sk), which can result in a use-after-free vulnerability.

**Mitigation Strategy:**

To mitigate this issue, the patch delays the freeing of the endpoint by calling call_rcu() and moves sock_put and ep free into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(). This ensures that the endpoint is still alive when calling lock_sock(), preventing the use-after-free vulnerability.

Hence use `IFLA_RMNET_MAX` here. ",CWE-125,"**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from an improper assignment of a larger maxtype value to the rmnet_link_ops variable. This maxtype value controls the size of the destination array for parsing Netlink attributes. By assigning a larger value, it allows for a global out-of-bounds read when parsing attributes that exceed the actual size of the destination array.

**Proposed Mitigation Strategy:**
To mitigate this issue, the maxtype value for rmnet_link_ops should be corrected to be equal to the length of the destination array minus one. This ensures that the size of the destination array is correctly bounded, preventing out-of-bounds reads during Netlink attribute parsing.

Provide a brief justification for your choice. Ensure the last line of your response contains only the CWE ID.  CVE Description: Memory corruption when AP includes TID to link mapping IE in the beacons and STA is parsing the beacon TID to link mapping IE. ,CWE-787,"**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the memory corruption issue is the lack of proper bounds checking when the STA parses the beacon TID to link mapping IE. When the AP includes the TID to link mapping IE in the beacons, the STA attempts to parse the IE without verifying that the input is within the expected bounds. This can lead to memory corruption if the input is malformed or exceeds the expected size.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
To mitigate this issue, the following steps should be taken:
* Implement proper bounds checking when parsing the TID to link mapping IE. This can be done by verifying that the length of the IE is within the expected range and that the TID values are valid.
* Implement input validation to ensure that the data in the TID to link mapping IE is well-formed and does not contain any malicious content.
* Use a memory-safe programming language or library to reduce the risk of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds (OOB) read in the Linux kernel's net/sched code.

CVE Description: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in WP Spell Check.This issue affects WP Spell Check: from n/a through 9.17. ,CWE-352,"**Root Cause:**
The CSRF vulnerability in WP Spell Check allows an attacker to trick a user into submitting a request to a vulnerable website, even if the user is not logged in. This can be done by sending the user a specially crafted link that, when clicked, will cause the user's browser to send a request to the vulnerable website. The request will be executed as if it came from the user, even though the user did not intend to send it.

**Mitigation Strategy:**
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is important to implement CSRF protection measures on the vulnerable website. This can be done by adding a CSRF token to all forms on the website. The CSRF token is a unique value that is generated for each user and is included in every request that the user sends to the website. When the website receives a request, it checks the CSRF token to make sure that it matches the token that was generated for the user. If the tokens do not match, the request is rejected."
